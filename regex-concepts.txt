Features: 
1. Character Set []
    eg. [abc]  - matches every word where its starting letters are either a or b or c
2. Ranges [a-zA-Z0-9]
3. Repeating Characters
    eg: 1. Unlimited matches [a-z]+, [0-9]+....
        2. Limited characters matches [a-z]{10} matches 10 characters, [0-9]{5}
        3. Limited characters matche range [a-z]{5,8} ; [0-9]{10-12}
        4. match atleast these many characters [a-z]{5,} ; matches atleast 5 characters or more
4. Metacharacters
    most commonly used are:
    1. \d : match any digit 0-9
    2. \w : match any word Character a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and underscore(_)
    3. \s : match any space or tab
    4. \t : match only tab
5. Special Characters
    + : one-o-more quantifier
    \ : escape character
    [] : character Set
    [^] : negation character Set
    * : zero-or-more quantifier
    . : any character whatsoever (except new line)
    ? : zero-or-one quantifier
6. Alternate characters
    | : eg: p|t either matches p or t
    () : eg: (p|t)yre matches either pyre or tyre

7. The only problem is when you need to include a / character in the literal form then you have to use an escape character. For example, to search for / in </div> say you would have to enter:
    var ex1=/<\/div>/;

8. remember to double up on the backslash in quoted strings. var ex1= new RegExp("ISBN\\d");

9. remember to use /\ if you want to search for a \ in RegExp literal.

10. There is also the convention that capital letters match the inverse set of characters:
    \D	any non-digit
    \S	any non white-space
    \W	any non-word character 


Implementation 
Two different ways to create a regular expression
 
1. let reg = /[abc]/ig;
2. let reg2 = new RegExp(/[abc]/, 'ig');
